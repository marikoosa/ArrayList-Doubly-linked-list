# ArrayList and a Doubly linked list of cells

## ArrayList
* ```Create()```: Creates an empty list.

* ```Private Grow```: Doubles the size of the array when it Grows.
* ```Append()``` Adds mobile objects at the last index.
* ```InPlaceSort()``` Sorts the array list in place without making a new Array.  
* ```Swap(index1, index2)```: Swaps the position of two elements in the array list
* ```DeleteLast```: Deletes the last element.  
* ```Public Static method Merge()``` Takes two ArrayLists, and produces a third one which is the first two merged in an unsorted order.  

## Doubly Linked List:
* ```Create()```: Creates an empty list.

* ```AddFront()```: Adds a new node at the head.
* ```AddLast()```: Adds a new node at the tail.
* ```InsertAtRandomLocation()```: keeps track of the size of the list, generates a random # up to that size, insert at that position in the list.
* ```Merge()```: Merges another list onto the calling one at the end.
* ```FindClosest()```: Returns the closest object to the one which calls this method.
